# Boston Housing Prices Prediction

## Predicting Median value of owner-occupied homes

The aim of this assignment is to learn the application of machine learning algorithms to data sets. This involves learning what data means, how to handle data, training, cross validation, prediction, testing your model, etc.

This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It was obtained from the StatLib archive, and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases. It can be used to predict the median value of a home, which is done here. There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:


In this kernel, I have built 7 regression models using Boston Housing Dataset. These are linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso, svr, decision tree and random forest regression. Then measured and visualized the performance of the models. 

Attribute Information:

    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

To Predict: MEDV
